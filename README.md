# Personal Library

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://personal-library.freecodecamp.rocks/. Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

1. Add your MongoDB connection string to .env without quotes as DB Example: `DB=mongodb://admin:pass@1234.mlab.com:1234/fccpersonallib`
2. In your `.env` file set `NODE_ENV` to `test`, without quotes
3. You need to create all routes within `routes/api.js`
4. You will create all functional tests in `tests/2_functional-tests.js`

This is the boilerplate for the Personal Library project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/personal-library
